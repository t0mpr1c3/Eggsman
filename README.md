# Eggsman
maze game in 10 lines of BASIC

## Purpose

Eggsman is a maze game featuring the eponymous protagonist, also known as Xylon Ximenez, whose task is to gather all the eggs in the henhouse before the evil snails crawl over and slime him. Having collected all the eggs he must rush to the exit get the eggs to market, and then do it all again the next day. Don't ask me why the henhouse is full of killer snails, it just is, OK? Life is hard, and then you die.

It's a maze with a twist. The eggboxes have turnstiles that Mr Ximenez can barge through but are impervious to snails. Grabbing the magic garlic clove renders snails edible for a little while. But don't step in the poop hazard. Every henhouse has one, directly under the roost.
